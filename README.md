# JOSM-Orphan-nodes-map-paint-style

A map paint style that highlights orphan nodes (those that have no tags and are not part of a way) and dims any other elements.

Adding the map paint style to JOSM: 

First, make the "Map paint style" window visible:

Add a name and a path to where you saved the "orphan_nodes.mapcss" file

The map paint style should then appear in the list. Check it and uncheck any other map paint style you can see there.
